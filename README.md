# Warehouse-Manager

The objective of this project was to carry out various experiments in an simulated warehouse which has a floor consisting of a grid of cells. Each cell has a robot which can deliver a package to an adjacent cell every minute. This was used to investigate various protocols that manage the movement of packets to its destination as efficiently as possible.

Each of the different managers built on top of each other but differed slightly in order to test efficiencies. An assumption while coding was that packets only could travel horizontal or verically and not diagonally.

The program can be run by downloading the files and running the RandomWarehouseApp.java file. To see all the different managers play around with the addRobots() method in the RandomWarehouse.java file.
